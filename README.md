## Description

PicMixer is a simple image processing application that allows users to pixelate a image uploaded to site and download the pixelated image. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript also bit of jQuery.

## Artistic Intent

The intent of this project was messing around with images. Found way to pixelate images and thought it would be fun to make a simple application that allows users to pixelate images. I am happy with the result and I think it is a fun little project.
